# Awesome Bioinformatics Consultants
Unordered, lightly curated list of bioinformatics consultants/companies inspired by the original (?) [Sean Davis single cell resource](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell)

The goal is to provide a list of people/companies to hire if you need a bioinformatics task accomplished.

Pull requests welcome! I haven't fully fleshed out what "keywords" are but I'd like it to be a field where you could (#hashtag-like) *briefly* (no more than 3?) explain your focus. 

Some examples I just made up:

    - #infrastructure
    - #cloudcomputing
    - #genomics
    - #analysis
    - #shiny
